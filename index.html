            <p data-line-number="1">Goin' out tonight, changes into something red</p>
            <p data-line-number="2">Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress</p>
            <p data-line-number="3">Everything she never had she's showin' off</p>
            <p data-line-number="4">     Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair </p>
            <p data-line-number="5">     She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget</p>
            <p data-line-number="6">     Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants</p>
            <p data-line-number="7">    We're only gettin' older, baby</p>
            <p data-line-number="8">     And I've been thinkin' about it lately</p>
            <p data-line-number="9">     Does it ever drive you crazy</p>
            <p data-line-number="10">     Just how fast the night changes?</p>
            <p data-line-number="11">     Everything that you've ever dreamed of</p>
            <p data-line-number="12">     Disappearing when you wake up</p>
            <p data-line-number="13">     But there's nothing to be afraid of</p>
            <p data-line-number="14">     Even when the night changes</p>
            <p data-line-number="15">     It will never change me and you</p>
            <p data-line-number="16">    Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head</p>
            <p data-line-number="17">    He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette</p>
            <p data-line-number="18">     Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop</p>
            <p data-line-number="19">     Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin</p>
            <p data-line-number="20">    She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet</p>
            <p data-line-number="21">     Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants</p>
            <p data-line-number="22">     We're only gettin' older, baby</p>
